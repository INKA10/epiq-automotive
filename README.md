Client requested a site where he could show off his business in the hopes of gaining more customers and promoting his auto shop online. Multipe API systems have been integrated into the website including a Google maps API, recall API, and a scheduled maintenance API. With our recall API, clients can enter in the Year, Make & Model of their vehicle and get back a list of current recalls. With our scheduled maintenance API, clients can enter in their vehicle's VIN number and recieve a list of recommended maintenance for their vehicle.  We have also integrated a contact section with direct links to all social media associated with Epiq Automotive. Contact also has a section where clients can enter in a name, email, phone number and a message to the owner for booking an appointment. Finally the site has a fully integrated carosel containing a gallery of automotive pictures.
